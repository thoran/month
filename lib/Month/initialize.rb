# Month/initialize

# 20111204
# 0.9.1

# Changes since 0.8: 
# 1. Version number bump to 0.9.0.  
# 2. See the Notes...  
# 3. + custom ArgumentError handling.  
# 4. It now checks that @month is in the range of 1 to 12
# 0/1
# 2. 

# Notes: 
# 1. With a view to compatibility with Francis Hwang's version of a Month class, and as a nod to Ruby's Date class, I have made it possible to supply the year optionally, but first, rather than second if there are two arguments.  
# 2. It might actually be nice if the Date class worked the same way.  
# 3. Generally I find it the Ruby way to assume that which can be assumed, and to only require explicitness when necessary.  In this instance that means that if I instantiate an object with a month only, then I should be able to assume the year.
