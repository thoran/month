0.10.0: Use a more conventional structure by removing the Month.rbl directory, get it working again, and create a gem.
1. - Month.rbl directory.
2. + Gemfile
3. + month.rb.gemspec
4. - lib/Array/lastX.rb: Not sure why this was here.
5. - lib/Array/all_but_last.rb: Not sure why this was here.
6. /ideas.txt/TODO.txt/
7. ~ lib/Month.rb: Removed date, version, description, and changes to the gemspec and the CHANGELOG.
8. + CHANGELOG.txt
9. ~ lib/Month/Constants.rb: - VERSION
10. + lib/Month/VERSION.rb
11. /Fixnum/Integer/ (It's been that long!)
12. /MiniTest/Minitest/ (It's been that long!)
13. /assert_equal nil,/assert_nil/: Now ready for Minitest 6!
14. ~ lib/Month.rb: + require 'Date/to_month'
